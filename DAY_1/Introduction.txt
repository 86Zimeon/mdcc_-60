GETTING STARTED WITH DJANGO
~~Since Django is a PYTHON framework you need to have a python 3.x installed on you machine :
  *******PYTHON INSTALLATION*****
    ->Windows :
        open cmd -> win + r then type cmd
        type ->winget install python
        verify installation -> python --version

    ->linux and mac :
        open terminal -> ctrl + alt + t(debian distros)
        type ->sudo apt install python3
        verify installation -> python3 --version
~~Once python is set-up you can proceed to have get started with django
  GETTING STARTED WITH DJANGO(SET-UP)
~~The recommended way to set up django is through use of virtual environments (VENV). Which is just a folder that is you project.
--This is to avoid compatibility issues incase you have an update in your machine resulting in missing dependencies and incompartible packages.

CREATING A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT
--STEP 1: CREATE A FOLDER e.g intro-to-django
    ->cd into the folder
--STEP 2:  CREATE THE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT
    -> type : python -m venv <name-of-environment> OR python3 -m venv <name-of-environment>
N.B -> this will install an interpreter specific to your project
--STEP 3: ACTIVATE THE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT
    -> Iside that folder navigate to :
          1.windows -> cd <name-of-environment>\Scripts\activate
          2.Linux/Mac  -> cd <name-of-environment>/bin/activate
INSTALLING DJANGO
Once the environment is setup you are ready to install DJANGO
              <<<< INSTALLING DJANGO USING PIP >>>>>
type -> python -m pip install Django
this will install a django version compartible with the interpreter for this project.
              <<<< VERIFICATION >>>>>
On your shell enter the python shell -> python or python3
      import django
      print(django.get_version())
ALTERNATIVELY :
      -> type :  python -m django --version
if you get a version then installation was successful.

                FIRST DJANGO PROJECT
~~Within your venv create a new django project :
      -> type : django-admin startproject <name-of-project>
#This creates a django project with this structure :
      MAIN-FOLDER/
    manage.py
    Django-Project/
        __init__.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        asgi.py
        wsgi.py
#That's how you setup a django project.
#HAPPY CODING
#DAY ONE DONE (^_^)
